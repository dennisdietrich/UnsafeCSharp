## Presentation title
Introduction to unsafe C#: Calling native code and crashing in entirely new ways

## Description
Does your C# code have enough access violations?
How about mutating supposedly immutable strings?
No?
What about buffer overflows or heap corruptions?
Learn how to do all of this in pure C#, no C or C++ required!
In this talk, weâ€™ll be looking at pointers, unions, unmanaged memory, implementing `IDisposable` and finalizers, and how to call native code.
